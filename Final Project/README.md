    This project is inspired by a problem that I have, and it is that I always forget the tasks I need to do. Even the tasks my mom or my dad ask me, for example: buy bread, go to the supermarket, etc.
So I thought that it would be nice to have a web application that is inspired by the todo list but you and your family can have tasks in conjunction. This web application consists of you as a user can create or enter an existing
family or create a new family (like clans in online games) and you have the option to create a task that will appear to every member of the family, and in addition, when a member of the family completes this task it will
not be shownd anymore for the family. So to summarize that, this web application is one that you can add tasks for you and click on done when they are done, but you can also enter or create a family where you and the other
members will have tasks in conjunction. The application has 6 sql tables to keep track of, the users, the families, the members of the families, the private tasks you have, the tasks from the family and a history table.
The application has a main tab where it shows all tasks you have (private or from the family), a tab where you add the tasks, a history tab that shows the user wich tasks he has completed and if they are from their family or
private the user can also clear the history, and finally a tab to create or enter a family, but if you already have a family it will show you the members.
